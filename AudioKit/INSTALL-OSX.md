# Using the AudioKit library in your OS X project
## Common Steps
* Drag and drop the `AudioKit.xcodeproj` file inside your own project in Xcode.
* In your project settings in Xcode, go to the **Build Phases** tab for your target.
	* Add a new **Target Dependency**. Pick the OS X library under AudioKit.
	* Expand the **Link Binary With Libraries** section, and add the same library from the previous step (now with a ".a" extension).
* In the **Build Settings** tab for your target :
	* Look for the **Other Linker Flags** setting, and set it to `-ObjC`
	* Look for the **User Header Search Paths** setting, point it to the location of the `AudioKit` directory, make sure to set it to **recursive**.  If your project directory is parallel to the AudioKit repository, this path will be `../AudioKit/AudioKit`.
*  From within the AudioKit subproject, open the `AudioKit > Platforms > OS X` group, then drag and drop the `CSoundLib.framework` file to your own project.  This will automatically add a "Framework Search Paths" entry for you, but it will be an absolute reference, so if you are sharing your projects with other, you should go to **Build Settings** Tab and add an entry relative to `$(SRCROOT)` that leads to `AudioKit/Platforms/OSX`.
* In your project settings, under the **Build Phases** tab, open the **Copy Files** section and add the same `CsoundLib.framework`.
* Add a new **Run Script** phase, of type `/bin/bash` with the following script:

`install_name_tool -change CsoundLib @executable_path/../Frameworks/CsoundLib.framework/Versions/6.0/CsoundLib $TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$EXECUTABLE_PATH`


## Swift Projects
* From within the AudioKit subproject in your project, open the `AudioKit > Platforms > Swift` group, and drag and drop `AudioKit.swift` to your project.
* Add `AKFoundation.h` to your Swift bridging header file.

## Optional Steps
Some of the built-in instruments require the use of some sound files, grouped in the `AKSoundFiles.bundle` in the **Resources** group in AudioKit. You may drag this bundle to your own project to have them included.

Similarly, you may want to drag and drop the `AudioKit.plist` file from the **Resources** group if you intend to change any of the settings in that file.
