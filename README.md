Twyst is a professional instrument for iPhone.

With just five buttons, Twyst is a real instrument that’s not only easy to learn, but easy to master. Start an impromptu jam session with your friends anywhere, anytime. Or plug in a pair of headphones and play along with your favorite tunes.

Simple in nature and sleek in design, Twyst is made for performance. Unlike other instrument apps that attempt to shrink down a full set of piano keys or a guitar neck, we designed Twyst from the ground-up to work beautifully with iPhone and do things analog instruments can’t.

* Play the entire scale using three note buttons
* Raise or lower the pitch with sharp and flat buttons
* “Twyst” iPhone away from you to jump up an octave
* Shake iPhone for vibrato that feels and sounds natural

And if you make some money playing Twyst on street corners, we’d love a cut
:wink:
